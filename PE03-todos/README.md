Input

Users can add new things to their to-do list by entering them in the input field and using the "Add" button.  They can also tap on additional tabs to view jobs by status: all, completed, or incomplete.

Process

When a new task is added, the app updates an internal list by saving the new entry. It also manages the state to organize and filter tasks depending on which tab the user selects.

Output
After adding a task, the to-do list updates right away to display the new item. Users can easily switch between tabs to see all tasks, only the ones they've completed, or those still pending.
