Input

The app allows users to interact through a clean and simple interface. They can type in new city names, browse a list of countries, and tap on items to explore more details about their currencies. Navigation is handled through tab and screen transitions, making it easy to switch between sections.

Process

Once a user inputs data or navigates through the app, it uses React Native's built-in components and navigation stacks to handle those actions. Whether it's adding a new city or viewing currency info, the app updates its internal state and re-renders the screen accordingly. The logic ensures smooth, responsive interaction.

Output

What users see on screen includes a live-updating list of their added cities, countries, and the respective currency info. The app responds instantly to any user action, updating lists or navigating to new screens without delay. It uses visual components like lists and scrollable views to present everything clearly.
