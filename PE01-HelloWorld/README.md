# Input
The user doesn't need to enter anything into this mobile app. The code already contains the data that is displayed on the screen, including the student's name, school, and degree program. There are no forms or interactions needed from the user to see the content.

# Process
Once the app is launched, it runs a function in the `App.js` file using React Native. This function returns a layout with one main View component that holds three Text components. Each Text element displays a separate line of information. A StyleSheet is used to apply the design—setting the background color to yellow and aligning everything neatly in the center of the screen using flexbox. The app is run and tested using Expo, which also supports real-time updates.

# Output
The result is a simple mobile app screen with a yellow background showing the user’s name, program, and school. The output is displayed on a smartphone using the Expo. It demonstrates a clear understanding.
