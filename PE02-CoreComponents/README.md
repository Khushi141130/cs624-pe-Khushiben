Input

The app allows users to enter their favorite MSCS course through a simple TextInput field. This input is optional and helps make the experience a bit more personal. At the same time, the app automatically loads a list of courses—including core, depth of study, and capstone classes—stored in arrays within the code.

Process

When the app starts, it builds the layout using key React Native components like View, Text, ScrollView, Image, and StyleSheet. The user interface is styled with internal styles for a consistent look. Course information is displayed using a reusable component, making the code cleaner and easier to manage. A vertical scroll feature ensures that all content is accessible on any screen size.

Output

The app displays a clean and organized screen that includes a course icon, a prompt for users to enter their favorite course, and a clearly categorized list of MSCS courses. The overall look is simple and easy to navigate.
