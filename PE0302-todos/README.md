Input
The user types in a new task and submits it using the input field. They can also switch between tabs labeled All, Active, and Complete to filter the list based on task status.

Process
When a tab is selected, the app runs a filter function that checks each task’s completion status. It updates the visible list by showing all tasks, only completed ones, or only those still pending.

Output
The screen displays a filtered list of todos depending on the selected tab. This allows the user to easily focus on all tasks, just those they’ve finished, or the ones they still need to complete.
