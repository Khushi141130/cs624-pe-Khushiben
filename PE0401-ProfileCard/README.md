Input:

The app takes in hardcoded user information such as the person's name, job title, and a short description. It also includes a profile picture that is loaded from a local image file stored in the project.

Process :

Using core React Native components like View, Text, and Image, the app builds a profile card layout. Custom styles are applied with StyleSheet to control spacing, alignment, colors, and text appearance, making sure everything looks clean and well-organized on the screen.

Output:

The final result is a centered profile card that displays the user's photo, name, occupation, and a brief intro. The layout is styled to match the example provided in the assignment, with clear text and a neat design.
